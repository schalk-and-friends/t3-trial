# schalk&friends - TYPO3 Trial work
So, you want to join our awesome TYPO3 Team?

Here we have a little task for you!

## Mission
1. Fork this Repo into your own Github Account
2. Create a Powermail contact form with the possibility to register for a newsletter as an optional option. If the option for a newsletter registration has been chosen, a additional opt-in process for e-mail verification should be triggered. If the option has not been chosen, no opt-in process is needed.
3. Create a Powermail form holding the following fields
 - Firstname (text)
 - Lastname (text)
 - E-Mail (text)
 - Subject (text)
 - Description (textare)
 - Register newsletter (checkbox)
 - Accept privacy policy (checkbox)
4. Create a extension and register a signal slot for triggering the opt-in process in Powermail (Send a mail to the given E-Mail address).
5. Send us a pull request.

## How we test
* We will clone this repo into an empty TYPO3 system
* We will enable the extension in the backend
* We will review your code approach with our team.

## Rules of engagement
* You can use Google or any other search engine for research
* Installing a third party plugin fullfilling the needs is not allowed, but if you know one, tell us.
* Your code should comply with the [TYPO3 Coding Guidelines](https://docs.typo3.org/typo3cms/CoreApiReference/CodingGuidelines/Index.html)
* Write awesome code!
* In case you have any questions you can always get back to us!
